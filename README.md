## Test Driven Development Server with Tape and Supertest

### Learning Outcomes
To understand the potential of faking requests to your server for the purposes of testing responses, using the tools below:

#### *Tape
Tape is an npm module used for testing server side code written in Node.js. This workshop will demonstrate using tape results piped through the tape-spec module to prettify the test response output

#### *Supertest
Supertest is used in this workshop to simulate fake server requests without the need to have the server listening via a socket connection to respond to the requests. Fake requests are simply objects passed to your routes.
